# Practice: Consume a Public API 🎮

## The Goal
In this exercise, you will make your first real API request to get a random joke!

## The API
We will use the **Official Joke API**: `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`

## Step 1: Use your Browser 🌐
The simplest way to "GET" data is to paste the URL in your browser address bar.
1.  Open a new tab.
2.  Paste: `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`
3.  Press Enter.
4.  You should see text like `{"type":"general","setup":"...","punchline":"...","id":...}`.

## Step 2: Use Postman 🚀
1.  Open Postman.
2.  Create a new Request.
3.  Set Method to `GET`.
4.  URL: `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`
5.  Click **Send**.
6.  View the "Pretty" JSON response at the bottom.

## Step 3: Challenge 🧠
Can you find an API that gives you a random dog image?
**Hint**: Search for "Dog CEO API" on Google.

## What you learned
-   Browsers make `GET` requests by default.
-   APIs return data (usually JSON).
-   You can look up documentation for other APIs to learn how to use them.
