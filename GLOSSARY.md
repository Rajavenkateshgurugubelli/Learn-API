A dictionary for API terms.

## A
-   **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules that allows computers to talk to each other.
-   **Authentication**: Verifying **who** a user is (e.g., Login).
-   **Authorization**: Verifying **what** a user is allowed to do (e.g., Admin vs User).

## B
-   **Body**: The data sent in an HTTP request or response (usually JSON).
-   **Base URL**: The common part of the API address (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).

-   **HTTP Methods**: Actions to perform (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).

## I
