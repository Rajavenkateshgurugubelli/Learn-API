# Introduction to APIs

## What is an API?
**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.
Think of it as a **waiter in a restaurant**.

### The Restaurant Analogy 🍽️
1.  **You (The Client)**: You are sitting at a table with a menu. You want food, but you can't go into the kitchen and cook it yourself.
2.  **The Kitchen (The Server)**: This is where the food (data) is prepared.
3.  **The Waiter (The API)**: You tell the waiter what you want (your order). The waiter takes your request to the kitchen, the kitchen prepares it, and the waiter brings the food back to you.

In software:
-   **You** are the app or website (Client).
-   **The Kitchen** is the database or server.
-   **The Waiter** is the API that connects the two.

## Why do we need them?
-   **Integration**: Allows different software to talk to each other (e.g., Uber using Google Maps).
-   **Security**: Hides the complex logic (the kitchen) from the user; you only see the menu.
-   **Efficiency**: You don't need to rebuild functionality that already exists (like payment processing with Stripe).

## Key Terms
-   **Client**: The one asking for data (Mobile App, Browser).
-   **Server**: The one providing data.
-   **Request**: The act of asking for something.
-   **Response**: The answer returned by the server.
